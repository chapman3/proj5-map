Assignment 5 - Map Points of Interest

Once again I have run out of time, this is not an operational project.


Completed so far:
    []map.py - reads a file of poi's using func.py and stores references in a session dict
             - serves map.html webpage
    []func.py - handles file parsing
    []map.html - contains map api usage derived from leaflet getting started guide
    
Still to-do:
    []Make base site functional
    []Make map operations functional
    []Expand on implementation

I probably should have tried to implement this incrementally, but that has become a task for another day.
